# Quadruped

This repo contains my work on a quadruped or 4 legged robot. There are multiple
versions located here.

- **RC Servo:** this is the original version. (code actually isn't here, I think I lost it)
- **XL-320 Smart Servo:** this version is located in the folder `xl320`
- **AX-12A Smart Servo:** this is the current version I am working on and is in
the `ax12` folder
- **Quadruped:** this is the code for either robot, that allows it to walk. It is
located in the `library` folder

## Required Software

This software requires [`pyservos`](https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/pyservos)
to run. This software talks to both the XL-320 and AX-12A servos from Robotis.

## History

### RC Servos

This was the original version, shown above around Aug 2016. It used toy RC
servos (9 g's), they didn't work that great.

### XL-320 Servos
